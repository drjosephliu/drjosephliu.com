description: How I built my new website and intend to use it for writing.

After a week of hacking away, version two of my new website is finally up and 
running. It's built with Gatsby, which is a static site generator based on React,
and the theme is modified from [Chris Nager's](https://github.com/chrisnager/chrisnager-dot-com).

## First experience using Gatsby

It was my first time using Gatsby and intially it was a toss up between Gatsby and
Hugo, which is another static site generator based on Go. Ultimately I chose Gatsby
for two reasons: I know React well and it's supposed to be easy to use. Judging 
from the rave reviews online, I was really expecting a Wordpress-like 
experience: pick a theme, do some minimal configuration and boom, you're good 
to go in a matter of hours. 

Nope. If you're expecting for Gatsby to be a walk in the park because you know 
React well, then you might be in for a shock. I say that with a slight caveat: 
if all you want is a blog out of the box, then fine, it really is as easy as 
downloading and running `gatsby develop`. But the second you want even the 
slightest bit of customisation, then you're going to have to dig underneath the 
hood. That means learning GraphQL, figuring out how Gatsby sources and transforms 
input  files, and fiddling around with `gatsby-node.js`; the hole runs pretty deep and 
next thing you know you're learning all you need to know to author an entire 
theme from scratch.

So what I expected to be a day project dragged out longer than expected.
No big deal. On the flip side, now that I have a good grasp of Gatsby, I can finally
see why people **do** love it. Writing my posts and project blurbs in markdown and yaml files
instead of hardcoding it into React components (which was what I was doing 
for version one) makes life so much easier. Importing images into components is
a breeze with `gatsby-plugin-sharp` and GraphQL and customising my theme is a
piece of cake with [theme-ui](https://theme-ui.com/).

## Reflections whilst going through old work

Ever since I went back to school two years ago, it's been a non-stop grind of classes,
projects and internships, so I hadn't really found the time to update my site in over a
year. Porting the content over from version one though required cleaning up readmes,
reviewing code and just making sure the work was somewhat presentable. It was 
also a good time to really look back and reflect on all the work I've done so far
since the beginning of my journey into programming. Here's what I found:
- Going back to school to learn CS was the best decision even though I am self-taught
  because there's no way I would have been able to do some of the class projects on
  my own.
- Having used React in all three of my internships, I can safely say that my first projects 
  on FreeCodeCamp were actually pretty good! Even if I didn't give them enough
  credit at the beginning because they were toy projects.
- Doing the entire frontend sequence for FreeCodeCamp was unnecessary. By the third 
  or fourth project, I had known enough to work in a job.
- The goal with going back to school was to learn more than just web development
  and I definitely achieved that.

## On writing

One of the reasons for rebuilding my site was because the first version had no
blogging capabilities because everything was hardcoded into React components. I've 
never been a prolific writer so why the sudden will to blog? For several reasons:
- I have a theory that people who write well, code well. 
- Writing aids learning. Every time I've had to write up a report or doc after finishing
  a project, I was able to gain a deeper understanding of it.
- To have skin in the game: publishing blog posts for the entire world to see (even
  if few actually do) forces you to think more clearly about what to say and write.
- The only way to get better is to do it.

As for what I'll be blogging about - for now it'll mostly just be about programming-related
stuff. People are usually curious about why I switched from medicine to software
and in fact, to this day, I still get many PMs on reddit asking for advice based on 
some comments I made a few years ago, so I'll add some career-related content too.
The internet's already filled with people telling you how to plan your career and succeed though,
and not enough about the other equally important things in life like friends, family, 
relationships and health, so maybe I'll sprinkle a few of those topics from time to time as well.
Is there anything you'd like me to write about? Please feel free to tell me in an email
below.

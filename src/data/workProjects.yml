    out various components to writing explainer docs and onboarding other interns.
    I also set up a centralised ELK logging server and optimised the risk engine.

  name: Explaining Diagnosis Results with LIME & Grouping Clinical Symptoms using Graph Algorithms
  summary: |
    My summer internship at Curai consisted of two projects. The first was to 
    use LIME to explain results from the diagnosis prediction model. The second
    was to implement an algorithm that groups similar clinical symptoms that 
    belong to the same hierachy.

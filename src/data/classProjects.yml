  name: Author Classification with BERT
  summary: |
    Final project for CIS 530 Natural Language Processing. We used the 
    Reuters_50_50 dataset, which consists of 5000 news articles by the top 50
    authors, and applied various models to predict author identification. The 
    best published accuracy was 69.1% by Qian et al (2017) using a GRU-based
    model. We smashed that with a 92.9% accuracy using an end-to-end embedding
    and classification model with BERT as a layer in a forward-feed neural 
    network and bag of words as an additional feature.

  name: Predicting the Success or Failure of Kickstarter Campaigns
  summary: |
    Final project for CIS 520 Machine Learning. We examined over 380,000 
    kickstarter campaigns spanning a period of 2009 to 2018 and fitted the data 
    across a variety of models: logistic regression, XGBoost, Adaboost, decision 
    tree, random forest and neural network. XGBoost performed best with an 
    accuracy of 70.23% and a recall of 43.64%.
